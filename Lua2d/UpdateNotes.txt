NOTES FOR THIS UPDATE

ADDED:
   
* General Notes
* More Readability

MAIN: 

- Instance: Table, Keeps track of UI Instances that have had a mouse button pressed while they were focused,
fires ButtonUp once it is released (fixed the problem of releasing on a different UI)

INSTANCE:

* TextOpacity: number (TextBox Instance)   Seperates TextOpacity from BackgroundOpacity
- UI Class now updates Instance's Children's Size and Position when updated respectively

Connections:

* Once:             Method (Fires a binded function once then unbinds the function and clears the memory);

STUDIO_UI:

* workplace_ui:     Instance (UI),  Manages what is drawn inside the Workplace (game) and scales it to fit.
Size updates dynamically with studio_ui sizes.

- All Button Types that are in or added to STUDIO_UI change in size with mouse (and automatically reformats the UI);
Not optimized + Not flexibile (Temporary and will change in the future)

CHANGED:

INSTANCE:

* Proxy table no longer takes memory to hold ID, Class, and Name and instead index's the main Object
- Enabled being disabled now does not prevent the object from being drawn, but prevents input events from being fired.


STUDIO_UI:

- All Objects changed to Button types

FIXES:

- MouseLeave is now fired when the mouse leaves the window 
- MouseEnter is now fired when the mouse enters the window
