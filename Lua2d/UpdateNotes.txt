NOTES FOR THIS UPDATE

* Added Studio_UI.lua, which will be the groundworks for making the UI for the game editor,
* Added ZIndex to UI Class,
Added AbsolutePosition to UI Class,
Added AbsoluteSize to UI Class,

Added check for Enabled and Visible when drawing objects with the UI class

NOTES: 

* Added note to Instance.lua to add something that automatically update absolutesize and absoulteposition with __index or __newindex in the future.

* Added note to table_to_string so people stop point that out as an ineffeciency. (It is a temporary debug tool until I get the
output UI working and make something optimized.)

Added notes to Main.lua to add ZIndex to the drawing
