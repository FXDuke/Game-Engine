# Lua2D
Lua2d is a game editor inspired by Roblox's Roblox Studio. Its aim is to provide the same simplicity that Roblox provides and get users inspired to develop games.

In the future I may be adding a 3d Renderer, so I may end up changing the name to something like "Luashop" or "Luaworks"

See Lua2d/UpdateNotes for updates
